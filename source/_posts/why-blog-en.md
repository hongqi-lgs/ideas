## Ideas Fade Away

Have you ever had this experience: you suddenly figured out a technical problem while taking a shower, or a brilliant product idea popped into your head during a walk, but by the time you sat down at your computer, it had already become as vague as a dream?

I've had it too many times.

The brain is for generating ideas, not for storing them. If you don't write them down, those flashes of inspiration will disappear forever into the river of time.

A blog is my external memory.

## Writing Is the Best Way to Learn

Feynman once said that if you can't explain a concept in simple language, you don't truly understand it.

Writing a technical blog is the practice of the Feynman Technique. When you try to write a concept clearly, you'll discover gaps in what you thought you understood. Filling those gaps is the process of truly learning.

Writing is not the result of learning — writing itself is learning.

## Leave a Trace

There's more and more content on the internet, but less and less genuine personal expression. Content on social media is fleeting; algorithms decide what gets seen and what gets forgotten.

A blog is your own space. No need to cater to algorithms, no need to chase traffic — just record honestly.

Ten years from now, looking back, these words will tell you how you used to think and the path you've walked.

This blog will cover:

- **Tech Notes** — Frontend, toolchains, architecture
- **Product Thinking** — UX and product design observations
- **Tools & Productivity** — Methods to work more efficiently
- **Thoughts** — Fragments of life

Not pursuing perfection, just pursuing authenticity.

Let's start writing.
